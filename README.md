# Instagram Bot

* People on Instagram take number of followers very seriously. Sometimes people follow others just to be followed back, but everytimes it doesn't happens as expected.
* The idea behind this project is to identify the people who are not following you even when you are following them. It returns a list of users with their instagram username.
* It uses selenium chrome driver to automate the process and is built using python.
